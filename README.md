# Introduction to Microservices - Labs

## Before starting

For both labs, you need to have Docker installed.

If you have not it yet, follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ to install it.


## Labs

These are introductory labs. You can run them in any order, but I recommend starting with Docker if you do not have experience with it.

- [Docker](docker-lab.md)
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes-lab.md)
